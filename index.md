# First Milestone
First Milestone Video:
I have just set up all of the basic components to help me get ready to modify my project. I have imported the code from the original Magic Mirror website into Visual Studio Code (VS Code) (What I will use to modify the code) and (at least tried to) set up the monitor which will go on the back of the mirror and give the illusion that the mirror is a mini-display. The raspberrypi is all set up and has a memory card in it that will hold the modified code. I can accesss it from my computer using VS Code as long as it's plugged in.

# Second Milestone
Second Milestone Video:
I this milestone video, I have just finished my base project with all the default modules. I got the display working and most of the modules are working the way they are intended to do. The one thing that I think I need to change is the fact that the compliments are way to big, and they are overlapping with the other modules. For my final milestone, I am planning on making everything look a lot cleaner, and maybe take out some of the components to keep the visuals very simple and easy to look at.
